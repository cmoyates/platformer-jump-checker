# Platformer Jump Checker

This is a test project I've put together to help me develop the [platformer AI](https://github.com/cmoyates/platformer-ai-test) for a game I'm working on.

This is directly based off of [this article](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/71392/how-do-i-determine-a-good-path-for-2d-artillery-projectiles) which I saw referenced in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNI2I8kzpnE).

## TODO

- [x] Implement the algorithm from the article
- [ ] Do something to handle corners properly
